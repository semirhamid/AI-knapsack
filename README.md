# Knapsack Problem Solver ðŸŽ’

Welcome to the Knapsack Problem Solver! This is a Python implementation for solving the classic Knapsack problem using various algorithms.

## About the Knapsack Problem

The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and combinatorial optimization. It is often described as follows:

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a knapsack so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is maximized.

## Features

- Implementation of various algorithms to solve the Knapsack problem, including:
  - Brute force
  - Dynamic programming
  - Greedy algorithm
  - Branch and bound
- Support for both 0/1 Knapsack (where each item can be either included or excluded) and Fractional Knapsack (where items can be divided)
- Customizable input for adding items with different weights and values
- Detailed explanation and comments in the code for better understanding

## Algorithms

### Brute Force
This algorithm tries all possible combinations of items and selects the one with the maximum value that satisfies the weight constraint.

### Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is used to solve the problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and solving them iteratively.

### Greedy Algorithm
The greedy algorithm selects items based on their value-to-weight ratio, choosing the item with the highest ratio first.

### Branch and Bound
Branch and bound is a more efficient version of the brute force approach, where branches that cannot lead to a better solution are pruned.
